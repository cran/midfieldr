Title: Tools and Methods for Working with MIDFIELD Data in 'R'
Version: 1.0.2
Description: Provides tools and demonstrates methods for working with individual 
  undergraduate student-level records (registrar's data) in 'R'. Tools include 
  filters for program codes, data sufficiency, and timely completion. Methods 
  include gathering blocs of records, computing quantitative metrics such as 
  graduation rate, and creating charts to visualize comparisons. 'midfieldr' 
  interacts with practice data provided in 'midfielddata', an R data package 
  available at <https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/>. 
  'midfieldr' also interacts with the full MIDFIELD database for users who have 
  access. This work is supported by the US National Science Foundation through 
  grant numbers 1545667 and 2142087.
